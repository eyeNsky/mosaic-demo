# mosaic-demo
Mosaic aerial images using enblend.
Depends on enblend, gdal, and exiftools.

Make a directory, enter said directory and execute get-data.sh. That will download some sample ortho imagery from the National Geodetic Survey.

Then execute python mosaic-demo.py.

Takes about 2 minutes to blend the images into a seamless mosaic.
